[Iris Messenger App]
Comprehensive messenger apps that allow for users to create an account with password, as well as logging in and out of the platform.  This app also includes all the basic functions of a modern-day messaging app, such as sending a direct message and viewing the history of chats.  Some additional functionality we speculate on including is the editing feature (move aside fb/twitter!), as well as a favorite/bookmark option and more!
